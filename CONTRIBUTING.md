## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

### Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asterdex-sdk.git
cd asterdex-sdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template (if available)
cp .env.example .env

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Environment Variables

For testing with real API credentials (optional):

```bash
ASTERDEX_API_KEY=your-api-key
ASTERDEX_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
ASTERDEX_ENVIRONMENT=testnet  # Always use testnet for development
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit real API credentials to the repository.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-futures-api` - New features
- `fix/websocket-reconnection` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/error-handling` - Code refactoring

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript
- Add proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Export all public types from the main index

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat: add new endpoint for futures trading`
- `fix: resolve websocket reconnection issue`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add unit tests for spot client`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- config.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Test both success and error scenarios

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('FeatureName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should handle normal case', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should handle error case', () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### JSDoc Comments

Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs:

```typescript
/**
 * Places a new order on the exchange
 *
 * @param params - Order parameters
 * @returns Promise resolving to order response
 * @throws {ValidationError} When required parameters are missing
 * @throws {ApiResponseError} When API returns an error
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const order = await client.spot.newOrder({
 *   symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
 *   side: 'BUY',
 *   type: 'LIMIT',
 *   quantity: '0.001',
 *   price: '35000'
 * });
 * ```
 */
public async newOrder(params: NewOrderParams): Promise<OrderAck> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Examples

- Add working examples for new features
- Update existing examples when APIs change
